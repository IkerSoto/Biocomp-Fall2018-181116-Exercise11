#Note: New files generated as an output and shell script files of the for loops used in this exercise can be found in 
#the directories named Question 1 Supplementary and Question 2 Supplementary  

##Exercise 1: Generating sequence alignments for the sporecoat and transporter gene
##sequences



##Sporecoat genes alignment##

#Using for loop to compile all spore gene sequences in a single file and add an empty 
#line between each sequence so that the sequences can be read by muscle. 
#Shell script saved under file named combining.sh
#Usage: bash combining.sh

for file in spore*.fasta
	>do
	>cat $file >> sporecoatgenes.fasta
	>echo "" >> sporecoatgenes.fasta
done

#This loop allows the user to open the spore sequence files one by one an then add an empty line.
#The output generated by the loop is stored in an appended new file named sporecoatgenes.fasta


##Running muscle to do the alignment of the spore coat gene sequences##

../muscle -in sporecoatgenes.fasta -out sporesaligned.fasta

#The aligned sequences are saved in file under name sporesaligned.fasta

##Transporter gene alignment

#Using for loop to compile all sequences in a single file and add an empty  
line between each sequence so that the sequences can be read by muscle. 
#Shell script saved under name combiningtransporters.sh
#Usage: bash combiningtransporters.sh


for file in transporter*.fasta
        >do
        >cat $file >> transportersgenes.fasta
        >echo "" >> transportersgenes.fasta
done

#This loop allows the user to open the transporter sequence files one by one an then add an empty line.
#The output generated by the loop is stored in an appended new file named transportersgenes.fasta


##Running muscle to do the alignment##

../muscle -in transportersgenes.fasta -out transporteraligned.fasta

#Aligned sequences saved in a file under the name transporteraligned.fasta

###Exercise 2 part 1 : Generating an HMM profile for the transporter gene

#Generation of an HMM profile of the transporter gene alignment by implementing hmmbuild. 
 
../hmmbuild transporterHMM.txt ../gene_sequences/transporteraligned.fasta 
 
#The HMM profile was stored in a new file named transporterHMM.txt


###Exercise 2 part 2: Using the HMM profile to search the eight bacterial proteomes. 

#Creating for loop to compare each of the 8 proteomes against our HMM transporter 
#profile
#Shell script saved under the name proteomehits.sh

#Usage: bash '*.fasta'
  
for file in $@
	>do
	> ../hmmsearch --tblout $file.out  transporterHMM.txt $file
done 
#The execution of this loop compared each proteome with the HMM profile and
# generated 8 new files with the names *.fasta.out where
# the '*' is substituted with the name of the specific proteome that was matched
#e.g. Bacillus.fasta.out

##Creating a file where the number of matches for each proteome are reported

#Using a for loop to count number of matches in each *.fasta.out file (by counting the
#lines that don't have a '#' character) and print this count
#alongside the name of the proteome it corresponds to in a single file.
#Shell script saved under the name matchcount.sh  
#Usage:bash '*.out'

for file in $@
do
	> echo $file `grep -c -v "#" $file` >> Counts.txt
done

#Output of this loop was stored in a file named Counts.txt
